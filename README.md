# crc_fpga

The aim of the project is to implement CRC generator at receiver side and error detection using a pre-known CRC at the receiver side.
We implemented this on small scale on an Icoboard(FPGA) with Raspberry pi as the processor. Inputs were given manually by setting the mode of fpga(either Rx or Tx) and the results were displayed.
